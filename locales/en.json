    "Questions": {
      "Q1": {
        "Q": "Why is there no subscription?",
        "A": "Because you shouldn't have to 'rent' software to look at your own photos. Modern companies use subscriptions to cover expensive cloud processing. Since Derustify runs on YOUR computer or phone, we have no server costs to pass on to you. You buy it, you own it. Period."
      },
      "Q2": {
        "Q": "Is it really private?",
        "A": "Yes. 100%. We physically cannot see your photos. All the AI magic happens inside your device's memory. No internet connection is required to restore images."
      },
      "Q3": {
        "Q": "Will it work on my device?",
        "A": "Derustify is built for modern Windows (10/11) and Android (8.0+). If you have a decent phone or a computer with a graphics card, it will be incredibly fast. If your device is older, it still works—it just takes a few extra seconds to 'clean' each photo."
      },
      "Q4": {
        "Q": "What's the catch with the Free version?",
        "A": "The free version has all the power of the Pro version. We just add a small watermark to the corner of your exported images. Upgrading to Pro removes the watermark and unlocks batch processing for those large boxes of family photos in the attic."
      },
      "Q5": {
        "Q": "Can I use it as a gift?",
        "A": "Absolutely. It's the perfect gift for the family historian, for your grandparents or anyone in the family that would appreciate restored memories. Purchase it once, install it on the family PC, and spend an afternoon rescuing the family archives together."
      },
      "Q6": {
        "Q": "Are the recolored images historically accurate?",
        "A": "No, the recolored images may have historical inaccuracies. The AI models are trained to restore color or to upscale images based on large samples of training data and often succeeds in correct output. Inaccurecies or inadequate coloring of images may occur, and Derustify does not gurarantee perfect results for all images."
